## üéØ Purpose of this document

This guide explains how to use the artificial intelligence tools available to the team to improve your development productivity. These tools are designed to **assist** you in your daily tasks, **not to replace you**.

## ‚ö†Ô∏è Important warning

> **AI tools are assistants, not replacements**
> 
> - They can make mistakes
> - They don't always understand the complete business context
> - Their code must **always** be reviewed and tested
> - Your human expertise remains **irreplaceable**
> - Never blindly trust AI suggestions

## üõ†Ô∏è Available tools

### 1. Opencode - Terminal AI Agent

[Opencode](https://opencode.ai) is an AI development agent that works directly in your terminal and understands your codebase.

#### Installation

```bash
# Installation via script (recommended)
curl -fsSL https://opencode.ai/install | bash

# Or via npm
npm install -g opencode-ai
```

#### Configuration

**Authentication options:**

1. **GitHub Copilot** (recommended for team consistency)
   ```bash
   opencode auth login
   # Select GitHub
   # Use your existing GitHub Copilot subscription
   ```

2. **Local LLM** (for privacy-sensitive work)
   ```bash
   opencode auth login
   # Select Local/Ollama
   # Configure your local model endpoint
   ```

**Note:** The project is already initialized with `AGENTS.md` file and pre-configured modes.

#### Project-specific Configuration

The project includes a pre-configured `opencode.json` with:

**üîß Specialized modes:**
- `build`: TDD development with Claude Sonnet 4
- `plan`: Planning mode with Gemini 2.5 Pro (read-only)
- `spec:*`: Complete specification-driven development workflow
- `tools:*`: Analysis and quality assurance tools

**üîå MCP Integration:**
- **Context7**: Provides up-to-date documentation for any library/framework
- Automatically resolves library names to current documentation
- Fetches version-specific code examples and API references

#### Using Context7 MCP

Context7 MCP is already configured and provides access to up-to-date documentation for thousands of libraries. You can:

1. **Ask for specific library docs:**
   ```
   How do I implement JWT authentication in Symfony? use context7
   ```

2. **Get version-specific examples:**
   ```
   Show me Doctrine ORM query builder examples for the latest version. use context7
   ```

3. **Reference specific libraries:**
   ```
   Configure Symfony Messenger with RabbitMQ. Use library /symfony/messenger for reference
   ```

**Context7 Benefits:**
- ‚úÖ Always up-to-date documentation (no outdated training data)
- ‚úÖ Version-specific API examples
- ‚úÖ Real code samples from official docs
- ‚úÖ No hallucinated APIs that don't exist

#### Recommended usage

**‚úÖ Best practices:**
- Ask for a plan before implementation
- Use Plan mode (`<TAB>`) for new features
- Provide business context and examples
- Specify existing files as references with `@`

**‚ùå Avoid:**
- Implementing critical features without supervision
- Accepting code without review
- Using for major architectural decisions alone
- Sharing sensitive information (credentials, client data)

#### Usage examples

```bash
# Understanding existing code with Context7 documentation
How is authentication handled in @src/Security/Common/User/ and how does it compare 
to Symfony's latest security best practices? use context7

# Planning a new feature (Plan mode)
<TAB>
I want to add an email notification system when a declaration status changes. 
Look at how it's done in @src/ThirdParty/ERP/ for inspiration and use Context7 
for Symfony Messenger documentation. use context7

# Direct implementation with up-to-date documentation
Add email validation in @src/Account/Common/Organization/Domain/Organization.php 
following Symfony Validator's latest patterns. use context7 /symfony/validator
```

### 2. Pre-configured Modes

The project includes specialized opencode modes tailored for different development phases:

#### Available Modes

```bash
# TDD Development
opencode --mode build              # Claude Sonnet 4 with TDD prompt

# Planning (read-only)
opencode --mode plan               # Gemini 2.5 Pro, no file modifications

# Specification-driven development
opencode --mode spec:plan          # Interactive project planning
opencode --mode spec:requirements  # EARS requirements definition
opencode --mode spec:design        # Technical design with various tech stacks
opencode --mode spec:tasks         # TDD task breakdown
opencode --mode spec:execute       # Implementation execution

# Analysis tools
opencode --mode tools:qa           # Quality assurance analysis
opencode --mode tools:understand   # Legacy code analysis
```

#### Mode-specific Features

**Build Mode (Default TDD):**
- Uses `@docs/agent/prompt/build.md`
- Follows Red-Green-Refactor cycle strictly
- Claude Sonnet 4 for implementation quality

**Plan Mode:**
- Read-only mode for safe planning
- No write/edit/bash tool access
- Ideal for architectural discussions

**Spec Modes:**
- Complete specification-driven development workflow
- EARS (Easy Approach to Requirements Syntax) format
- Different models optimized for each phase

### 3. Context7 MCP Server

[Context7](https://context7.com) is a Model Context Protocol (MCP) server that provides up-to-date documentation for thousands of libraries and frameworks, already integrated into the project.

#### What Context7 Solves

**‚ùå Without Context7:**
- Code examples are outdated (based on year-old training data)
- Hallucinated APIs that don't exist
- Generic answers for old package versions

**‚úÖ With Context7:**
- Always up-to-date, version-specific documentation
- Real code samples from official sources
- No hallucinated APIs

#### How to Use Context7

1. **Add `use context7` to your prompts:**
   ```
   Create a Symfony form with file upload validation. use context7
   ```

2. **Reference specific libraries:**
   ```
   Configure Doctrine migrations. Use library /doctrine/migrations for reference
   ```

3. **Get framework-specific best practices:**
   ```
   Implement API Platform custom filters following current best practices. use context7
   ```

#### Context7 Integration Status

The project's `opencode.json` includes Context7 MCP configuration:
```json
"mcp": {
  "context7": {
    "type": "local",
    "command": ["npx", "-y", "@upstash/context7-mcp"],
    "enabled": true
  }
}
```

This means Context7 is automatically available in all opencode sessions.

### 4. Local agent prompts

The project contains structured prompts in `docs/agent/prompt/` that work seamlessly with the configured modes.

#### Prompt structure

```
docs/agent/prompt/
‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ spec/              # Specification-driven development
‚îÇ   ‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ plan.md       # Project planning
